- Prevention of military vehicle counting (direct and indirect)
- Content moderation for sensitive military imagery

**In Scope:**
- Military vehicles (tanks, armored vehicles, military trucks)
- Military aircraft (fighters, bombers, helicopters)
- Military ships (warships, submarines, naval vessels)
- Military equipment and installations
- Indirect military content (wheels, tracks, components)

**Out of Scope:**
- Civilian vehicles and aircraft
- Commercial ships and boats
- Civilian buildings and infrastructure
- Non-military equipment

## Ethical Considerations

### Safety and Security

- **Purpose:** Prevents misuse of AI systems for military surveillance
- **Transparency:** Open about model limitations and capabilities
- **Accountability:** Clear documentation of decision-making process
- **Privacy:** No real military imagery used in training

### Potential Risks

- **False Positives:** May block legitimate civilian content
- **False Negatives:** May miss sophisticated military content
- **Bias:** Synthetic data may not capture real-world diversity
- **Adversarial Attacks:** Model may be vulnerable to adversarial examples

### Mitigation Strategies

- Regular model updates with diverse training data
- Human-in-the-loop validation for edge cases
- Continuous monitoring of model performance
- Transparent reporting of safety statistics

## Limitations and Biases

### Known Limitations

1. **Synthetic Training Data:** Model trained on synthetic data may not generalize to real-world images
2. **Limited Diversity:** Training data may not capture all military vehicle variations
3. **Context Sensitivity:** Model may struggle with partial or obscured vehicles
4. **Adversarial Robustness:** Susceptible to adversarial attacks

### Potential Biases

1. **Geographic Bias:** Training data may favor certain military vehicle designs
2. **Temporal Bias:** Model may not recognize newer military technologies
3. **Cultural Bias:** May not account for different military equipment designs
4. **Scale Bias:** May struggle with very small or very large vehicles

### Recommendations for Use

- Use as part of a multi-layered safety system
- Implement human review for high-stakes decisions
- Regular model retraining with diverse data
- Monitor for false positive/negative patterns
