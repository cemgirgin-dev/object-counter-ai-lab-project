# 🚀 AI Engineering Lab - Week 3 Quick Start Guide

## ✅ System Status: READY

The complete Week 3 AI Safety & Production Readiness system is now implemented and ready to use!

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Startup Script (Recommended)
```bash
./start_system.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Startup
```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Start Backend with Safety System
cd backend && python main.py &

# 3. Start Frontend
cd frontend && flutter run -d web-server --web-port 3000 &

# 4. Start Monitoring
./start_monitoring.sh
```

## 🌐 Access Points

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Frontend** | http://localhost:3000 | Flutter web application |
| **Backend API** | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI with safety system |
| **API Docs** | http://localhost:8000/docs | Swagger documentation |
| **Safety Stats** | http://localhost:8000/api/safety-stats | Safety system statistics |
| **Prometheus** | http://localhost:9090 | Metrics collection |
| **Grafana** | http://localhost:3001 | Monitoring dashboard (admin/admin) |

## 🛡️ Safety System Features

- **Military Vehicle Detection**: Prevents counting of military vehicles
- **Text Analysis**: Detects military-related keywords in object types
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Safety metrics and block statistics
- **Fallback Protection**: System continues working even if safety check fails

## 🧪 Testing the Safety System

1. **Upload an image** with object type "tank" (military keyword)
2. **Check safety statistics** at `/api/safety-stats`
3. **Monitor in Grafana** for safety blocks and metrics
4. **View API documentation** at `/docs` for all endpoints

## 📊 Monitoring Features

- Real-time safety block monitoring
- Model performance metrics
- Request rate and response time tracking
- Safety confidence distribution
- Model accuracy over time

## 🔧 A100 GPU Training

The GitLab CI pipeline is ready for A100 GPU training:

1. **Push to `safety-mechanism` branch** triggers training
2. **A100 GPU** will train the military vehicle detection model
3. **Trained model** will be available as artifacts
4. **Deploy model** to replace random weights

## 🛑 Stopping the System

```bash
# Stop all services
pkill -f 'python main.py'
pkill -f 'flutter run'
docker-compose down
```
